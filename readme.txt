Tools and Libraries used

    Kotlin as the programming language
    Coroutines for managing background tasks
    MVVM architecture for the app's structure
    LiveData for handling data in a lifecycle-aware manner
    ViewBinding for efficient access to views
    Dagger Hilt for dependency injection

    Room for the local data storage

How to use

Notes

    An API key from TheMovieDB is required to access the movie data. You can get one by registering on their website.
    The app is currently set up to use a hardcoded API key for demonstration purposes. Replace it with your own API key in the Retrofit configuration file.
